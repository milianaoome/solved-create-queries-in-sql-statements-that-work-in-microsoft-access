B) Join Dealership and Employee tables and display all columns. Include dealerships with no employees. You must use LEFT JOIN and ON syntax for this query.

C) Join Dealership and Employee tables and display all columns. Include employees with no dealerships. You must use RIGHT JOIN and ON syntax for this query.

E) Join Customer, Relationship, and Dealership tables and display all columns. You must use INNER JOIN and ON syntax for this query.
